# Task: Add support for "options" field in dynamic details for admission pipeline steps

## Completed Steps
- Updated frontend/src/pages/Supervisor.jsx to support editing "options" field for dynamic details of type "select".
- Updated backend/src/routes/admissionRoutes.js to handle "options" field in POST and PUT routes for step dynamic details.
- Verified backend/src/models/stepDynamicDetails.js supports "options" field in database operations.
- Updated frontend/src/features/admission/ApplicantsBoard.jsx to render select dropdown for dynamic details of type "select" with options.
- Updated backend/schema.sql to include "options" column in step_dynamic_details table.
- Added "options" column to existing database using ALTER TABLE.

## Next Steps
- Test the full flow of creating, editing, and deleting dynamic details with "options" field in the UI.
- Verify that the "options" field is correctly persisted and retrieved from the backend.
- Ensure no regressions in existing functionality for dynamic details without "options".
- Optionally add validation or UI improvements for the "options" input format (comma separated values).

This completes the implementation of the "options" field support for dynamic details in the admission pipeline steps.
