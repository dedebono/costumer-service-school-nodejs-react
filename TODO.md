# Fix CSCompleted.jsx - Queue Customer Data Display

## Tasks to Complete:

- [x] Update customer name display logic in CSCompleted.jsx to check both `customer_name` and `queue_customer_name`
- [x] Update customer phone display logic to check both `customer_phone` and `queue_customer_phone` 
- [x] Update CSV export to include correct customer information from both sources
- [ ] Test the changes to ensure customer names from queue_customers are displayed correctly

## Progress:
- [x] Analyzed the issue and created plan
- [x] Got user confirmation to proceed
- [x] Implement the fixes
- [ ] Verify the changes work correctly

## Changes Made:
1. **Customer Name Display**: Updated `{t.customer_name || 'Anonymous'}` to `{t.customer_name || t.queue_customer_name || 'Anonymous'}`
2. **CSV Export**: Updated customer name and phone fields to include both regular customers and queue customers:
   - 'Customer Name': `t.customer_name || t.queue_customer_name || ''`
   - 'Customer Phone': `t.customer_phone || t.queue_customer_phone || ''`

## Summary:
The CSCompleted.jsx file now properly displays customer information from both the `customers` table and `queue_customers` table, eliminating the "Anonymous" display issue when queue customer data is available.
